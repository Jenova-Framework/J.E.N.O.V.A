## 🪶 What is it?
**Projekt J.E.N.O.V.A** is an extension library for the Godot 4 Game Engine that brings fully-featured C++ scripting directly into the Godot Editor. It allows the use of modern C++20 standards within the Godot Engine, similar to GDScript.

With Projekt J.E.N.O.V.A, there are no limits. You can integrate OpenCV, CUDA, Vulkan, OpenMP, and any other modern C++ features, all supported by the powerful MSVC backend.  
By using the Jenova Framework, you can program your entire game in C++ without any issues. It also provides security features to protect your code and assets in the future.

**It is a dream come true!**

## 📋 Source Code
Jenova Source Code is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jenova-Framework/Jenova-Runtime) for everyone under the MIT license.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Jenova only supports Godot 4.2+, Windows 7 to 11 x64. Linux and Mac support are not planned for now.  
> Currently, Jenova only provides MSVC support. However, you can use Visual Studio directly.  
> If you need C++ scripting with support for Linux or Mac, you can use [Godot Sandbox](https://github.com/libriscv/godot-sandbox).

> [!NOTE]  
> Current builds do not include the Virtual Machine and Emulator. While the code for these features is present, they are disabled because they are still heavily under development.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Current builds are in the Alpha stage. Backup your project files! You may experience data loss!
